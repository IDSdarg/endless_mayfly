# Burned After Reading: Endless Mayfly’s Ephemeral Disinformation Campaign

This repository contains datasets generated during the investigation on the Endless Mayfly Disinformation Campaign by the [Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca/).

This dataset includes the following CSV files:

* `domains.csv`: List of domains registered by the operators
* `fake_articles.csv`: List of fake articles published by the operators
* `personas_bylines.csv`: List of articles published on open platforms by personas used in this campaign
* `3rd_party_articles.csv`: List of articles published on third-party websites based on fake information published in this campaign
* `Short_urls.csv`: List of short links used by the personas that redirected to the inauthentic articles
* `Personas Twitter activity` [folder]: Personas’ Twitter activity pulled from Twitter’s API.

While we are aware that the data above is partial, it is representative of some of the strategies and tactics employed by this campaign and may be useful for other researchers conducting their own investigations.
